     Not the extreme ones who are always eating and all but the occassional ones. This is aided by the fact that I have no known allergies to any substance or foods whatsoever. So among the foods and drinks that I like there are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Foods made with <stong>rice</strong></li>
      <p>This is mainly because I am a huuge fan of rice. Be it plain rice, pilau, biriani(biriyani) and many more that I haven't yet encountered</p>
      <li>Meat</li>
      <li>Minji</li>
      <li>Kamande</li>
      <li>Mukimo</li>
      <li>Chapati</li>
      <li>Samosas</li>
      <li>Mutura</li>
      <li>Mshikaki</li>
      <li>Meatpies</li>
      <li>...mahn the list is endless.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Well people and food couldn't be the only things that I like.<em>"laughs"</em>
      I have some other hobbies that I like doing such as <em>riding bikes, reading novels, I used to love playing the guitar, taking nature walks, adventure, sitting on rooftops being hit by the gushing wind, hanging out with friends, watching movies and playing computer and mobile games.</em>

      I have also started taking programming and coding classes by myself recently. It has been quite interesting though I feel like I'm going too slow in my progress.So I guess I'll have to up my speed a lot.
      I've been doing this using notes from one of the best IT schools in Kenya called <em>Moringa School</em> <a href="https://moringaschool.com/courses/software-development-course?gclid=Cj0KCQjwreT8BRDTARIsAJLI0KIAUQUsjsNTMImskWSGFsmKq281GH5pruZMF3qOMgHewPZLHgK0hmcaAg-ZEALw_wcB&utm_campaign=august_class&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_term=brand_campaigns">link to website</a>
      In case you would also like to take up their classes I hope the link will prove to be useful.<strong>Godspeed!</strong>
