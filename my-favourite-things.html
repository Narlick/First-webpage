      My Favourite Things.

    <p>
      First of, I'll start with my friends. I generally don't have a lot of friends(I'm picky as fuck) plus didn't like socializing much before. Anyway, they include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nimrod Kimani</li>
      <li>Amos Masibo</li>
      <li>Joyce Maina </li>
      <li>Mary Mwangi </li>
      <li>Beta</li>
      <li>Anne Wariara</li>
      <li>Nancy Mutheu</li>
      <li>Bravin Mberia</li>
      <li>Felix Musyoki</li>

      <li>Mercy Mburu</li>
      <li>Esther Kiguru</li>
      <li><em>...And so on<em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Besides from friends I'm a foodie. Not the extreme ones who are always eating and all but the occassional ones. This is aided by the fact that I have no known allergies to any substance or foods whatsoever. So among the foods and drinks that I like there are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Foods made with rice</li>
      <p>This is mainly because I am a huuge fan of rice. Be it plain rice, pilau, biriani(biriyani) and many more that I haven't yet encountered</p>
      <li>Meat</li>
      <li>Minji</li>
      <li>Kamande</li>
      <li>Mukimo</li>
      <li>Chapati</li>
      <li>Samosas</li>
      <li>Mutura</li>
      <li>Mshikaki</li>
      <li>Meatpies</li>
      <li>...mahn the list is endless.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Well people and food couldn't be the only things that I like."laughs"
      I have some other hobbies that I like doing such as riding bikes, reading novels, I used to love playing the guitar, taking nature walks, adventure, sitting on rooftops being hit by the gushing wind, hanging out with friends, watching movies and playing computer and mobile games.
